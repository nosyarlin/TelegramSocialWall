# About The Project

My friend is having a wedding and he wanted to add a social media wall to the wedding for their guests to post well wishes and photographs from the wedding. However, we were not able to find a good and affordable solution anywhere. So, being the software engineer that I am, I decided to code this social wall from scratch instead of just paying for one.
